        Whisk is an **app** that helps busy home cooks plan and cook multiple dishes efficiently for their friends and family. It keeps track of your available ingredients, provide relevant _recipe_ suggestions, and simplifies the cooking process by merging all the instructions into a single list of [google](www.google.com) steps.

        In this project, I worked closely with 3 students and took the lead to design our deliverables and the visuals of the application. Later on, I took the initiative to redesign the whole app. See the final work.

        We began the project by conducting semi-structured interviews with adults home cooks that don’t cook as an occupation to understand their cooking habits, meal choices, struggles, and so on. We also conducted a competitive analysis with products related to our user group such as Blue Apron, FridgeCam, BuzzFeed Tasty, and others to understand the scope of existing solutions within this problem space.

        ## Pain Points

        From our research, we mainly realized that our interviewees

        * Can’t keep track of their available ingredients and hence don’t know what to cook from time to time.

        * Get stressed when cooking under time constraints since they can’t decide on recipes that fit the time limit.

        * Find it difficult to cook several dishes at the same time.


        ## Synthesis

        With our research learnings, we created 2 personas that embodied the archetypes of our user group. We then mapped out the user journey of our persona Ray, including his thoughts and feelings during his typical weekday. From this, we were able to temporally visualize Ray's areas of frustrations and create a focal point on the problem space.
