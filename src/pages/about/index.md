Whisk is an app that helps busy home cooks plan and cook multiple dishes efficiently for their friends and family. It keeps track of your available ingredients, provide relevant recipe suggestions, and simplifies the cooking process by merging all the instructions into a single list of steps.

In this project, I worked closely with 3 students and took the lead to design our deliverable and the visuals of the application. Later on, I took the initiative to redesign the whole app. See the final work.


We began the project by conducting semi-structured interviews with adults home cooks that don’t cook as an occupation to understand their cooking habits, meal choices, struggles, and so on. We also conducted a competitive analysis with products related to our user group such as Blue Apron, FridgeCam, BuzzFeed Tasty, and others to understand the scope of existing solutions within this problem space.

**Pain Points**
From our research, we mainly realized that our interviewees:

* Find it difficult to cook several dishes at the same time.

**Synthesis**
With our research leanings, we created 2 personas that embodied the archetypes of our user group. We then mapped out the user journey of our persona Ray, including his thoughts and feelings during his typical weekday. From this, we were able to temporally visualize Ray's areas of frustrations and create a focal point on the problem space.
