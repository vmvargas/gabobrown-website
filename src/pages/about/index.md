I'm a product designer with years of experience in visual and interaction design, capable of crafting world-class products from scratch.

Now I'm working in a special project called [**Devengo**](www.devengo.com)**.** As the only product designer, I took the responsibility from strategy to the design of the product, **a mobile app for salary advances**. Followed lean startup approach: MVP and rapid iterations. During this time I was involved in some projects with the marketing and business departments., rapidly growing enterprise startup environment - taught me how to balance business goals and engineering constraints as I unrelentingly advocated for the user.

I graduated from **The Institute of Design of Caracas, Venezuela** with a degree in **Graphic Design**, then I did my first **certification in Design Management** at the [**University of The Arts: London**](https://www.arts.ac.uk) and now I'm currently doing an **MSI in UX and Research Design** at the [**University of Michigan**](https://umich.edu). I love human-centered design methods and everything that is related to inclusive design.

I grew up between so many cultures that my ability to quickly adjust to new challenges in life comes from that. Owing to my diverse upbringing, I embrace all cultures and try to bring it to the designs I create.
