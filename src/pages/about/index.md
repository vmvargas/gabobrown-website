At the end of the 9th grade when our teachers asked us to write down our future aspirations in the yearbook, I wrote that I wanted to become a designer. While I had no idea at the time, I now know that being a designer means thinking outside the frame. It means asking the right questions, developing a critical & thoughtful process, implementing an idea with a strong craft â€” and above all else, advocating for real people with real needs.

What excites me about design is being able to work at the crossroads of art, engineering, business, & psychology and with some of the coolest, most creative minds in the industry. What inspires me about design is being able to craft experiences that strengthens connection and creates a sense of community for others. Previously, I've designed products for [**Devengo**](https://www.devengo.com)**ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸**, [**Haper's BAZAAR**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/harpers-bazaar-magazine-us/id489949431) **ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§**, [**Resourcify**](http://resourcify.de)**ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª** and [**98point6**](https://www.98point6.com)ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§among some other amazing projects. And, at moment I'm focusing all my attention on working at [**Alkemy**](www.alkemy.com) as a UX/UI Consultant and getting my MBA at [**EAE Business School**](https://www.eae.es) in Madrid.

When Iâ€™m not dreaming up solutions in a Figma file, Iâ€™m probably learning how to mix the business, the design, and the Psychology world. When Iâ€™m not online, Iâ€™m probably engaging in fruitful conversation, catching some fresh air, inching through my bookshelf, or turning the places I visit pastel.
