        In early 2019, we started a pitch at Loycus where I had the chance to
        develop - for the first time in my life - a style for the new
        illustration system. This system was going to be used all over the
        Loycus Platform. Crazy enough the style that I proposed ended up being
        selected to define Loycus Illustration's new identity.




        I called the new style “JoyCus”, a mix between the words Joy-ful and
        Cus-tomer. My intention was creating characters where joyfulness was
        part of the illustration core.




        After a long process of hard work from the amazing Loycus team, we
        agreed that my illustrations were going to be the starting point in
        creating a style guide and a toolkit. This style defined the palettes,
        forms, and animations.

        Using the insights I gathered from the research, I began creating user
        flows.


        The first part of the research was to understand why is the trend moving
        towards social? Benefits of using social over traditional selling
        methods. The biggest difference between social selling and traditional
        sales techniques is that while the latter focuses mainly on short-term
        sales results, social selling is more about building long-lasting
        relationships.


        I started creating the information architecture and low-fi concepts for
        primary use cases. After having a go-ahead from the Product Manager,
        developers, and Stakeholders on the mockups, we began to conduct
        usability tests with the low-fidelity mockups. Once we had confidence in
        the design, we began digitalizing designs.
