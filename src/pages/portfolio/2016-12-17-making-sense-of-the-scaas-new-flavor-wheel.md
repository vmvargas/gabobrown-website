        Social selling is a way for sales teams to use social media to connect
        with prospects and provide them with value. Consider it similar to lead
        nurturing, in the sense that the idea is to engage buyers on an
        on-going, long-term basis.




        The goal of this project was to come up with a tool for Nu Skin
        distributors that allows them to connect with their prospects, built and
        maintain relationships and convert them into customers.

        Using the insights I gathered from the research, I began creating user
        flows.


        The first part of the research was to understand why is the trend moving
        towards social? Benefits of using social over traditional selling
        methods. The biggest difference between social selling and traditional
        sales techniques is that while the latter focuses mainly on short-term
        sales results, social selling is more about building long-lasting
        relationships.


        I started creating the information architecture and low-fi concepts for
        primary use cases. After having a go-ahead from the Product Manager,
        developers, and Stakeholders on the mockups, we began to conduct
        usability tests with the low-fidelity mockups. Once we had confidence in
        the design, we began digitalizing designs.
