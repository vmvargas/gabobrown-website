  results made by IDB and also works as a tool to explore effective skills
  development programs.

        Despite governments’ best efforts, many people in Latin America and the
        Caribbean don’t have the skills they need in order to succeed in
        different social, academic, economic and professional environments. This
        app draws together the “do´s” and “don´ts” regarding the implementation
        of different programs and policies that can easily be searched by
        governments in their quest to help their citizens improving their life
        quality.

        As you can imagine the IDB has huge pools of information, data and case
        studies which leads us to a primary problem: **how are we going to
        organize all of this info in such a limited space?** For instance, in
        the previous platform, it could take up to +2 weeks for users to find
        what they need. In this sense, our main goal was for the user to be able
        to find any useful information in less than 2 days.


        Additionally, there was another tiny _\-not that tiny -_ problem: **the
        client didn’t want literally any colour in the user interface.**

        Me and my team started to do the research process based on all the data
        that the bank provided and looking to see if the competitors already had
        something similar in the market. 


        After gathering all the information, we mapped out an end-to-end user
        journey of a government’s employee to visualize areas where pain-points
        might arise. After overviewing the research experience, we synthesized
        an initial hypothesis that governments’ employees tend to look at tables
        and statistics rather than the text itself.


        To understand the problem scope and the research experience from both
        sides, we conducted 5 semi-structured interviews with the IDB
        specialists and government’ employees and created an online survey that
        got 42 respondents.

        To test our concept, we created paper prototypes that demonstrate key
        user flow. The paper prototype allowed us to brainstorm on main features
        without expending too many resources. We iterated on our wireframe by
        conducting guerrilla usability testing with paper prototypes. With a
        total of 8 participants, we aimed to validate the solution concepts,
        clarity on components, and user efficiency. 

         

        We iterated on our paper prototypes by conducting guerrilla usability
        testing with 8 participants. We recruited our participants in the IDB
        offices, where the app and website would be likely to be used. The goal
        was to test the solution concept, clarity of components, and user
        efficiency. The participants gave great feedback including concerns
        about edge case scenarios. Unfortunately I forgot to take photos of the
        paper prototypes and that's why you won't find any pictures bellow.

        We started designing high fidelity prototypes by creating a style guide
        for the user interface and determining major screens of the website
        first - this was a client requirement - as we usually design mobile
        first. We used Sketch for UI design and
        [Principle](https://principleformac.com) for motion design.


        In this phase, we had to resolve our last tiny not-that-tiny issue, the
        non-color interface. After 5 attempts to design an appropriate black and
        white interface we determined that it wasn’t a viable option, thus we
        collected all the pros and cons (basically there were just cons, to be
        honest) and presented it to the client. After a 5 hours meeting - no
        exaggeration - they understood the problem and agreed to use 2 colours
        (blue and purple)

        Since the app and website were launched the BankSkills has received 10x
        more downloads and tons of positive feedback on how the product has
        helped users save time. 


        Furthermore, the IDB wrote an amazing book-based database that
        accompanies the digital platform, aggregates evidence on skills
        development policies throughout the life cycle.

        **Collaboration is key:** The more eyes on a design, the more it’s
        exposed to varying opinions, experience, and critique — and this can
        only ultimately improve it. Or at the very least, test it.


        **Process in essential:** For a project this vast, it gives you a
        roadmap to navigate through what can be a foggy route. This is
        especially useful when you’re starting out.
