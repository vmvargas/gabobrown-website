        The company wanted to design an **app that could be both a social
        network and an interactive map** where users could see live all cyber
        attacks in all the continents. When the project was first handed to me
        they already had some designs and user flows, but that was precisely wat
        they DID NOT wanted. These user flows and maps were _\-in my opinion-_
        in really good shape, however Blueliv needed to changed them completely.

        I didn’t have any type of familiarity with the topic so the frist step
        was educating myself. When I fully understood most of it I asked them
        more data thus I could create some personas and a more accurate user
        journey.

         

        To test our concept, I created paper prototypes that demonstrate key
        user flow. Paper prototype allowed me to brainstorm on main features
        without expending too much resources. I iterated on our wireframe by
        conducting guerrilla usability testing with paper prototypes. With the
        total of 10 participants, we aimed to validate solution concept, clarity
        on components, and user efficiency.

        One of the main goals was scalability. At the moment of the launch, we
        had only two sources of data: the map and the threats. The design
        solution should be flexible enough to easily add more sources of data:
        reports, sandbox, statistics and more. I conceived of  a cards-based
        interface. By using them, we were able to add more and more data sources
        in a very easy way, virtually without any limits.


        We started designing high fidelity prototypes by creating a style guide
        for the user interface and determining major screens of the website
        first _\- this was a client requirement -_ we usually design mobile
        first. We used [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) for UI design and
        [Principle](https://principleformac.com) for motion design.

        1. **Don't spend too much time on refining things before everyone
        agree**. I did these mistake where I was too focus on refining one hi-fi
        wireframes. Limit the wireframes and aim for function.

        2. **Make sure hire in-house developer.** We spent lot of time managing,
        communicating, & assisting the development of the app. This make the
        development take long time. Hire great developers where they can
        implement your idea and supportive. No matter how good, how fancy, how
        neat you design the interface & interaction; if you can't get a good
        developer, this will not likely happen.
