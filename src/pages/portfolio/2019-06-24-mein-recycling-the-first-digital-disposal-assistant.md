        your commercial waste, sites, disposers and organizes them in one app,
        making the recycling process way easier. The app also helps companies of

        They had a very strong user experience but they needed help with the
        user interface of the app. In the beginning, I thought it would be a
        really smooth project considering all the user experience was already
        done. Nonetheless, it was incredibly challenging to combine the good
        practices of UI with the existing UX.

        Once the client gave me all the flows, wireframes and architecture of
        the information, I started working on the first concept of the app. I
        was inspired to embrace iOS9Â´s guidelines and don't do much custom
        control in order to save time in the development phase. It needed to be
        light and warm, use clear typography, and focus on content.


        Then I started the UI process. I started with the most important pages
        and went from there to the least important ones. Since the constraint of
        the project didn't let me spend a lot of time exploring things, I
        skipped the low-fi and went straight to the hi-fi wireframes (more like
        an early version of the design mockup). I used the Sketch app since it
        lets me measure things effortlessly.


        Once most of the screens were there, team members provide constructive
        feedback based on agreed user flow. Later, we came up with some feedback
        to improve the app. To save time in the tight deadline, instead of doing
        the improvements on the hi-fi wireframes we decided to incorporate the
        improvements on the final design. 


        To design the final mockup we needed to set the tone of the app that
        reflected the brand of the product. Since the app didn't have this set
        yet, I created a quick simple brand guideline to ensure all the design
        process will follow the guides and become more consistent.

        1. As a freelancer, **it's important for you to balance between
        different features according to timeline and budget**. Make sure you
        make an efficient design decision.

        2. **Collaborating and communicating is always vital in every aspect of
        the design process.** When the devs need your support and guidance, be
        available for them because they're the people who are gonna make your
        design come to life.
