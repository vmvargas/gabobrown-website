  An ambitious plan for the development of all the company's websites with a
  single design system updated technology, and focus on user experience. The use
  of common technology, coupled with the great diversity of countries,
  languages, and currencies will be a challenge for the 220 professionals
  involved, who have already completed the first 24 websites, and will work on
  this project until 2023.

This case study will be focused only on the UX/UI part.\n\nThe role I played in this project was **UI &** **UX Consultant.** We were a team of 6 -incredible- product specialists ([Elena Benito](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elena-benito-miralles-28743253/), [Olmo Romero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olmor/), [Almudena Trujillano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/almudena-trujillano-rojano-productdesigner-ux-ui/), [Antonio Jimeno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonio-jimeno/), [Pablo de Juan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pablo-de-juan-mas/) and [Bianca Brachetti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bianca-bracchetti-6089a5177/)).

        * 1 **unique Design System** covering local gaps and different types of
        parks (theme, aquatics, zoos & resorts)

        * **Harmonise technology** (common CMS, e-commerce tool, backend &
        analytics)

        * **Simpler technical maintenance** and daily management

        * **Strengthen digital** team and capacities, working in an agile way

        * **Increase not paid traffic** (\~8-15%) and conversion rate (\~20%)

        * **EBITDA impact**: from €15M in 21 months (assuming a normal year) to
        + €12M in 24 months

    - description: "At this point, knowing the project goals, it was time to identify the main problems in their current websites. Listed below are some of the main issues \U0001F6A9 we saw in the Legacy webs:\n\n1. Not user friendly \n2. Small text, CTAs that weren’t clear and confusing navigation\n3. The menu header wasn't clear\n4. Not accessible\n5. Bad responsive experience\n6. Too many (confusing) steps during the ticket purchase process causing users leakage in the most important steps"

    - description: "After identifying the general bugs and defining our goals for the project, we proceed to divide the parks into waves, each wave had a specific thematic and reason to be:\n\n* \U0001F30A\U0001F3A2 Wave 1   \\_\\_\\_\\__   **European Themed Parks**\n* \U0001F30A\U0001F3A1 Wave 2 \\_\\_\\_\\_ **American & Australian Themed Parks**\n* \U0001F30A\U0001F43C Wave 3 \\_\\_\\_\\_ **ZOOs & Aquariums**\n* \U0001F30A\U0001F3E8 Wave 4 \\_\\_\\_\\_ **Resort Parks**\n* \U0001F30A\U0001F4A7 Wave 5 \\_\\_\\_\\_ **Aquatic Parks** \n\nHence, we proceed to interview a responsible for each park, so we could gather the maximum information about their current pain points with their webs and payment funnels, and also, to understand the cultural differences and needs of each park to take them into account while designing the new platform. Furthermore, using these insights we crafted 10 personas, to capture the pain points and frustrations of our target users."

        Thanks to the research we conducted previously, we came up with a
        component-like type of solution for this project. Meaning that all parks
        will have a unique design system where they can customize the colours,
        fonts, and currency.




        First, we defined them to a functional level, validating their
        functionalities with the key stakeholders, making sure they will be
        fully responsive, accessible, and coherent throughout the whole web.

        With these, we ran five concept tests and then settled on a user flow
        that we would use to begin creating  Lo-fi prototypes of the components.
        The key part of this process was determining exactly which questions we
        needed to validate with the stakeholders and what problems we were
        solving for the user, and in what order. 


        Below we can appreciate a very, very... very simplified example of this
        process.

    - description: "We faced 3 main challenges while designing the design system, those were:\n\n\n\n* Neutral Interface that could be accessible to all parks\n* Customisable interface where branding should be shown on the interface\n* Skeuomorphism vs. Flat design, going from more to less.\n\n\n\nEvery design system is supported on top of some main basics that will help to build the rest of the components and give unity and consistency to all the elements\n\n\n\n**\U0001F4D0 Grid**: To give a basis for where the website will be built. We established a 12-column grid for desktop and a 4-column for mobile.\n\n**\U0001F524 Typography**: Two were proposed by the team (Anton & Barlow), but parks were treated particularly in case they needed another font.\n\n**\U0001F3A8 Colours**: Defined according to each park’s branding system \n\n**\U0001F3A2 Iconography and patterns**: Unique and simple style for all parks to enhance the communication and help the brand to be more powerful."
