        An ambitious plan for the development of all Parques Reunidos' websites
        with a single design system, updated technology, and focus on user
        experience. The use of common technology, coupled with the great
        diversity of countries, languages, and currencies was a challenge not
        only for me but for the other 220 professionals that were involved. We
        have already completed the first 24 websites in Europe, the U.S.A, and
        Australia, and we couldn't be prouder of the results.


        The full case study for **this project will be published soon**, but
        meanwhile, you can [**watch a glimpse of
        it**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6910197295351226368/),
        hope you enjoy the ride (literally).
