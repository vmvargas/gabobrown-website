    - description: "At this point, knowing the project goals, it was time to identify the main problems in their current websites. Listed below are some of the main issues \U0001F6A9 we saw in the Legacy webs:\n\n1. Not user friendly \n2. Small text, CTAs that weren’t clear and confusing navigation\n3. The menu header wasn't clear\n4. Not accessible\n5. Bad responsive experience\n6. Too many (confusing) steps during the ticket purchase process causing users leakage in the most important steps"
      name: Understanding the problem
      number: 3
    - description: "After identifying the general bugs and defining our goals for the project, we proceed to divide the parks into waves, each wave had a specific thematic and reason to be:\n\n\n\n* \U0001F30A\U0001F3A2 Wave 1   \\_\\_\\_\\__   **European Themed Parks**\n* \U0001F30A\U0001F3A1 Wave 2 \\_\\_\\_\\_ **American & Australian Themed Parks**\n* \U0001F30A\U0001F43C Wave 3 \\_\\_\\_\\_ **ZOOs & Aquariums**\n* \U0001F30A\U0001F3E8 Wave \\_\\_\\_\\_ **Resort Parks**\n* \U0001F30A\U0001F4A7 Wave 5 \\_\\_\\_\\_ **Aquatic Parks** \n\n\n\nHence, we proceed to interview a responsible for each park, so we could gather the maximum information about their current pain points with their webs and payment funnels, and also, to understand the cultural differences and needs of each park to take them into account while designing the new platform. Furthermore, using these insights we crafted 10 personas, to capture the pain points and frustrations of our target users."

        Thanks to the research we conducted previously, we came up with a
        component-like type of solution for this project. Meaning that all parks
        will have a unique design system where they can customize the colours,
        fonts, and currency.




        First, we defined them to a functional level, validating their
        functionalities with the key stakeholders, making sure they will be
        fully responsive, accessible, and coherent throughout the whole web.
