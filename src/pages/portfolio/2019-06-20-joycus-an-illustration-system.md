  This illustration system is a way to enrich a Loycus's visual language and say
  more nuanced things that a logo, color scheme, typeface, or even words cannot
  convey alone.

        In early 2019, we started a pitch at Loycus where I had the chance to
        develop - for the first time in my life - a style for the new
        illustration system. This system was going to be used all over the
        Loycus Platform. Crazy enough the style that I proposed ended up being
        selected to define Loycus Illustration's new identity.




        I called the new style “JoyCus”, a mix between the words Joy-ful and
        Cus-tomer. My intention was creating characters where joyfulness was
        part of the illustration core.




        After a long process of hard work from the amazing Loycus team, we
        agreed that my illustrations were going to be the starting point in
        creating a style guide and a toolkit. This style defined the palettes,
        forms, and animations.

        Human figures are used to add warmth, they help build an emotional
        connection and tell the story. Characters are stylized and not
        anatomically precise. Composed of irregular shapes, characters are
        designed for corporal expression rather than individual identity or a
        face expression itself.

        At the essence of Product, Illustration is the clever use of simple
        primary shapes. Landscapes, animals, and people are created by adding
        and subtracting geometric shapes from one another.

        Illustrations can create inspiring content for the context of what is
        being served. Exaggerated forms are used for their expressive nature and
        ability to fit into tight compositions. This unique style is important
        for achieving effective integration between product interactions and
        product environment.

        Be open to new projects.  As a UI - UX Designer sometimes we tend to
        forget other divisions of design, and turns out you can be really
        talented in some other areas as illustration, data analysis, etc.
