        Despite governments’ best efforts, many people in Latin America and the
        Caribbean don’t have the skills they need to thrive. This platform looks
        at what policies work, and don’t work, so that governments can help
        people learn better and realize their potential throughout their
        lifetimes.

        As you can imagine The IDB has tons of information, data and case
        studies and this leads us to the primary problem which was how are we
        going to concentrate all that information in a very limited space and
        the second issue was that in the previous platform it took +2 weeks for
        the users to find what they needed so the question was how are we going
        to make it easier for the users to find the information they need in
        less than 2 days?


        Furthermore, there was a - tiny, not that tiny - third issue and it was
        that the client didn’t want any - literally any - colour in the user
        interface.

        Having these two obstacles, me and my team started to do the research
        process based on all the data that the bank provided and looking to see
        if the competitors already had something similar in the market. 


        After gathering all the information, we mapped out an end-to-end user
        journey of a government’ employee to visualize areas where pain-points
        might arise. After overviewing the research experience, we synthesized
        an initial hypothesis that governments’ employees tend to look at tables
        and statistics rather than text itself.


        To understand the problem scope and the research experience from both
        sides, we conducted 5 semi-structured interviews with IDB specialists
        and government’ employees and created an online survey that got 42
        respondents.

        To test our concept, we created paper prototypes that demonstrate key
        user flow. Paper prototype allowed us to brainstorm on main features
        without expending too much resources. We iterated on our wireframe by
        conducting guerrilla usability testing with paper prototypes. With a
        total of 8 participants, we aimed to validate solution concept, clarity
        on components, and user efficiency.


        We iterated on our paper prototypes by conducting guerrilla usability
        testing with 8 participants. We recruited our participants in The IDB
        offices, where the app and website would be likely to be used. The goal
        was to test solution concept, clarity of components, and user
        efficiency. The participants gave great feedback including concerns
        about edge case scenarios. Unfortunately I forgot to take photos of the
        paper prototypes and that's why you won't find any pictures bellow.

        We started designing high fidelity prototypes by creating a style guide
        for the user interface and determining major screens of the website
        first - this was a client requirement - we usually design mobile first.
        We used Sketch for user interface design and
        [Principle](https://principleformac.com) for motion design. 


        In this phase we had to resolve our last tiny not-that-tiny issue, the
        non-colour interface, after 5 attempts to design an appropriate black
        and white interface we determined that it wasn’t a viable option, thus
        we collected all the pros and cons (basically there were just cons to be
        honest) and presented it to the client, after a 5 hours meeting - no
        exaggeration - they understood the problem and agreed to use 2 colours
        (blue and purple)

        Since the app and website were launched the BankSkills has received 10x
        more downloads and tons of positive feedback on how the product has
        helped users save time. Moreover, the IDB SkillsBank wrote a book-based
        database that accompanies the website/app, aggregates evidence on skills
        development policies throughout the life cycle.

        **Collaboration is key:** The more eyes on a design, the more it’s
        exposed to varying opinions, experience, and critique — and this can
        only ultimately improve it. Or at the very least, test it.

         

        **Process in essential:** For a project that is vast, it gives you a
        roadmap to navigate through what can be a foggy route. This is
        especially useful when you’re starting out
